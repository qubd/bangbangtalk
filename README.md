It's some material from my !!con 2016 talk, including the slides (with a bonus section on why ECDSA works that I needed to cut out of the talk) and the python code I used to generate addresses, which depends on [mini_ecdsa](https://github.com/qubd/mini_ecdsa), and a [blockchain.info API](https://github.com/blockchain/api-v1-client-python).

If you're interested in learning about elliptic curve cryptography, and need somewhere to start, I would check out [this series on Andrea Corbellini's blog](http://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/).
